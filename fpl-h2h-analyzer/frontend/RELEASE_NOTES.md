# Release Notes - FPL H2H Analyzer v7.0

## 🚀 Version 7.0 - Performance & Animation Update
*Release Date: May 29, 2025*

### 🎯 Overview
This major release introduces comprehensive performance optimizations and a sophisticated animation system, achieving our targets of <1s initial load, <100ms interactions, and consistent 60fps animations. The application now features cutting-edge performance monitoring, intelligent caching, and smooth micro-interactions throughout.

### ✨ New Features

#### Performance Optimization (Step 8)

    - charts-vendor: Data visualization libraries
    - 3d-vendor: Three.js and React Three Fiber
    - animation-vendor: Framer Motion
    - utils-vendor: Axios and Socket.io

- **📊 Performance Monitoring**
  - Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB, FCP)
  - Real-time FPS monitoring for animations
  - API response time tracking
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Bundle size tracking
  - Component render time measurements

- **💾 Multi-Layer Caching System**
  - In-memory LRU cache for hot data
  - IndexedDB for persistent storage
  - Intelligent TTL based on data type:
    - Live data: 30 seconds
    - League standings: 1 hour
    - Manager history: 24 hours
    - Analytics: 5 minutes
  - Stale-while-revalidate strategy
  - Cache hit rate tracking

- **⚡ Bundle Optimization**
  - Tree shaking with optimal settings
  - Brotli and Gzip compression
  - Asset optimization and inlining
  - Source map exclusion in production
  - Terser minification with console removal

#### Animation System (Step 9)
- **🎨 Comprehensive Animation Library**
  - 20+ reusable animation variants
  - Consistent timing and easing functions
  - Gesture-based interactions
  - Scroll-triggered animations
  - 3D transforms and morphing

- **✨ Micro-Interactions**
  - AnimatedButton with ripple effects
  - AnimatedNumber with count-up and celebrations
  - AnimatedCard with hover transforms
  - Score change indicators with bounce effects
  - Success celebrations with particle systems
  - Loading skeletons with shimmer effects

- **🔄 Page Transitions**
  - Smooth route transitions (fade, slide, scale)
  - Shared element animations
  - Exit animations for components
  - Staggered list animations

- **🎯 Performance-Optimized Animations**
  - Respects prefers-reduced-motion
  - Hardware acceleration for all transforms
  - 60fps guarantee with FPS monitoring
  - Batch animation updates
  - RequestAnimationFrame optimization
