# Git Commit Feature Command

**Purpose:** Create structured, professional git commits for feature implementation following conventional commit standards optimized for the FPL H2H Analyzer project.

## Usage
```bash
> /git-commit-feature FeatureName
```

## Template Prompt

```
create a comprehensive git commit for the {FeatureName} implementation following our project standards:

## 1. Pre-Commit Validation

### Code Quality Check
```bash
# Run linting and tests
/test-and-lint

# Ensure no console.log statements in production code
grep -r "console.log" frontend/src --exclude-dir=node_modules || echo "‚úÖ No console.log found"

# Check for TODO comments that should be addressed
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" frontend/src backend/app --exclude-dir=node_modules || echo "‚úÖ No unresolved TODOs"

# Validate TypeScript compilation
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```

### File Organization Check
```bash
# Ensure new files follow project structure
find frontend/src -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -10
find backend/app -name "*.py" | head -10

# Check for unused imports
cd frontend && npx eslint src/ --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --quiet --rule "no-unused-vars: error"
```

## 2. Git Status Review

```bash
# Review all changes
git status

# Show detailed diff
git diff --stat

# Review specific file changes
git diff HEAD~1..HEAD --name-only

## 4. Commit Examples

### Feature Implementation
```bash
git commit -m "feat(ui): implement glassmorphism design system for modern 2025 aesthetics

- Add comprehensive glassmorphism color palette with rgba values
- Create GlassCard base component with backdrop-filter effects
- Implement glass navigation tabs with smooth transitions
- Add hover animations with transform and glow effects
- Update ThemeProvider with modern gradient definitions
- Ensure browser fallbacks for backdrop-filter support

Performance impact:
- Bundle size: +12KB (glass effect utilities)
- Animation performance: 60fps maintained
- Browser compatibility: 95% (fallbacks for older browsers)

Breaking changes: None - backward compatible with existing components

Closes #123
Addresses MODERNIZATION_ANALYSIS requirements for visual transformation"
```

### Analytics Feature
```bash
git commit -m "feat(analytics): add AI-powered prediction insights with confidence visualization

- Implement AIInsightsPanel component with typewriter animation
- Add ConfidenceBar with animated progress indicators  
- Create PredictionCards with ML recommendation display
- Integrate real-time prediction updates via WebSocket
- Add scenario analysis with visual comparison charts
- Implement predictive scoring with confidence intervals

Analytics enhancements:
- ML prediction accuracy: 87% (baseline: 82%)
- Real-time prediction updates: <100ms latency
- Confidence visualization: Dynamic progress bars
- Scenario modeling: 5 different prediction scenarios

API endpoints added:
- GET /api/analytics/v2/h2h/comprehensive/{m1}/{m2}
- GET /api/analytics/prediction-scenarios/{m1}/{m2}
- WebSocket: /ws/analytics/live-tracking/{m1}/{m2}

Resolves #456
Part of Phase 3: Advanced Features implementation"
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
git commit -m "perf(frontend): optimize bundle size and implement advanced code splitting

- Implement dynamic imports for analytics components (-340KB)
- Add React.lazy for Three.js 3D visualizations (-280KB)  
- Optimize Framer Motion tree shaking (-120KB)
- Implement service worker caching for API responses
- Add image lazy loading with intersection observer
- Optimize WebSocket message batching for performance

Performance improvements:
- Initial bundle size: 2.8MB ‚Üí 2.1MB (-25%)
- Time to interactive: 2.5s ‚Üí 1.8s (-28%)
- Lighthouse performance: 85 ‚Üí 94 (+9 points)
- Animation frame rate: 60fps maintained
- Memory usage: -15% during navigation

Bundle analysis:
- Core app: 800KB (was 1.2MB)
- Analytics modules: Lazy loaded on demand
- Three.js: Loaded only when 3D features accessed
- Charts: Split by visualization type

No breaking changes - all features remain functional

Fixes #789
Addresses performance targets from MODERNIZATION_ANALYSIS"
```

### WebSocket Enhancement
```bash
git commit -m "feat(websocket): enhance real-time features with room-based subscriptions

- Implement advanced room management for H2H battles
- Add automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Create WebSocket health monitoring with visual indicators
- Add message batching for high-frequency updates
- Implement rate limiting with graceful degradation
- Create connection state persistence across page reloads

Real-time improvements:
- Connection stability: 99.8% uptime
- Reconnection time: <2 seconds average
- Message latency: <50ms (was 150ms)
- Concurrent connections: 1000+ supported
- Rate limiting: 100 messages/minute per client

New WebSocket features:
- Room-based subscriptions (league, H2H, manager-specific)
- Heartbeat monitoring with ping/pong
- Connection state visualization in header
- Automatic subscription restoration on reconnect
- Graceful fallback to polling when WebSocket unavailable

WebSocket endpoints:
- /ws/connect (main connection with reconnection)
- /ws/h2h-battle/{m1}/{m2} (battle-specific updates)
- /ws/league/{league_id} (league-wide updates)
- /ws/manager/{manager_id} (manager-specific updates)

Backward compatible with existing WebSocket connections
