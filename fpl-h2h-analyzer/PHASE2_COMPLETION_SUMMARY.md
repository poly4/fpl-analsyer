## 💡 Usage Examples

### Using Modern Components:
```jsx
import { GlassCard, AnimatedNumber, BadgeCollection } from './components/modern';

// Glassmorphic container
<GlassCard variant="elevated" gradient="custom-gradient">
  <AnimatedNumber value={1234} format="currency" />
  <BadgeCollection badges={['topScorer', 'consistent']} />
</GlassCard>
```

### Interactive Features:
```jsx
import InteractiveAnalytics from './components/InteractiveAnalytics';

// Drag-and-drop analytics dashboard
<InteractiveAnalytics leagueId={leagueId} />
```
